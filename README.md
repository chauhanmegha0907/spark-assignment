In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic,the project aims at creating a comprehensive system for analyzing and presenting COVID-19 data from various countries. Leveraging Python, RapidAPI, Spark, and RESTful APIs, I developed a solution to collect, process, and analyze COVID-19 data for at least 20 countries. The project not only involves gathering raw data but also focuses on deriving meaningful insights to better understand the impact of the pandemic across different regions.

Data Collection:
Using the RapidAPI service, I accessed the 'https://disease.sh/v3/covid-19/countries/{country_name}' API to retrieve the latest COVID-19 data for a diverse set of countries. This data includes information such as total confirmed cases, total deaths, total recoveries, and critical cases. I meticulously compiled this data and organized it into a CSV file for further analysis.

1.First download all the files as a zip and extract them in your code editor. 
2.Run api_requests.py to fetch all the csv files from given api.
3.df.ipynb should be run to merge all the csv and make a dataframe.
4.Then run ques1_restapi.py to fetch all the covid data.
5.run all the q2.1 to start server request
6. go live on html page and deploy it to see results.

Conclusion:
In conclusion,the project offers a comprehensive solution for analyzing and presenting COVID-19 data, providing valuable insights into the global impact of the pandemic.
